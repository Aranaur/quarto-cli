        Make sure to check [Quarto Issues](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues) and [Feature Requests GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/categories/feature-requests) first to see if your feature request has already been discussed.
        If it has, you can add a comment to the existing discussion instead of creating a new one.

        After checking, if you are not sure if your feature request has already been discussed, you can still create a new discussion. ðŸ˜‰

        If you want to ask for help, please use the [Q&A GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/categories/q-a).

        Finally, try to describe the best you can what you want to achieve and why you think it is important.
        This will help us to understand your request and prioritise it.
